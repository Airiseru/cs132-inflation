                        <p>Did you know that in 2012, bangus (or milkfish) was P76 less expensive per kilo than in 2022
                            (Statista, 2023)? As prices continue to rise over time, people are finding it more and more
                            difficult to afford things that they used to be able to afford. Will the general public be
                            able to keep up with the increase in prices moving forward? What exactly are the factors
                            that affect the apparent increase in prices? How worried should we be given that inflation
                            is being viewed as an “urgent national concern?”</p>

                    <p>The title of “the Sick Man of Asia” has once again been given to the Philippines.</p>

                    <p>In recent years, the Philippines has experienced a plethora of problems regarding inflation, as
                        the
                        average yearly inflation has soared to 6.6%, which makes the Philippines the country with the
                        highest inflation rate among all Southeast Asian nations ever since the pandemic.</p>

                    <p>However despite the increase of inflation and overall price of goods, majority of the workers
                        have
                        yet to receive an increase of wage. In fact, majority of the full-time workers receive an
                        average
                        monthly basic pay of PHP 13,000. That is why, in the Philippines, inflation is mostly perceived
                        in
                        a negative light due to the concern that it has adverse effects on the people, especially for
                        those
                        with a limited income.</p>

                    <p>That is why we decided to focus on inflation rate. We wanted to see the trend of inflation rate
                        and
                        determine the possible factors or events that ultimately affect the ongoing worry of being able
                        to
                        afford basic needs and wants.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, the lack of awareness and understanding about inflation and its effects causes a
                        negative perception on the topic. This leaves policymakers, businesses, and the general public,
                        especially those in lower income brackets, vulnerable and unprepared to deal with the rapid
                        changes in inflation and the effects that come with it.</p>

                        inflation rates to increase awareness, change our perception of inflation, and possibly take

                                <p class="mb-3">It can be observed that the AR(1) models with seasonality have a relatively larger Root Mean Squared Error. This means that the difference between the predicted and the actual values for the model was relatively larger. This may be due to the behavior of the AR(1) model. Having fewer terms in the characteristic polynomial, the behavior is limited to be close to linear.

                                    These models follow the average trend of the data better but are not good at predicting the spikes and dips in the data. They do, however, have a high value returned from the Ljung-Box test, indicating a high level of randomness in the model predictions, so each predicted data point is less dependent on previous data, which is good for a predictive model.

                                </p>

                                    As for Health and Transport, where different parameters were used, we can see that we obtained a smaller Root Mean Squared Error. This means that the distance between predicted and actual values is relatively smaller than the other models. Due to the behavior of their ARIMA models, the characteristic polynomial had more terms, which allowed for more fluctuations in the prediction. This allowed them to make more accurate predictions, especially since the original data also had many fluctuations.

                                </p>

                                    The p-values obtained from their Ljung-Box tests, however, are low, especially for Health, which was less than 0.05. This means that for Health, the predicted data points need to be sufficiently random, and that residuals might affect the prediction of new data points due to high correlation with previous data points.

                                To test the hypothesis, a simple linear regression test based on the OLS model was used

                        It might seem that the behavior of inflation is unstable and unpredictable, but we can decompose its behavior into respective components. While there seems to be an increasing trend in inflation rate, it is not strictly increasing either — we observed that the data is actually mostly stationary and seasonal, meaning there are patterns that we can observe and use as reference. Since inflation seems to be stationary and positive, we can guess that prices will continue to increase at the same rate it has before.

                    <p>
                        The inflation rate also fluctuates rapidly depending on the state of the economy while following a stationary average. Furthermore, it is hard to predict whether the inflation rate of the upcoming month or year will significantly increase or decrease from the present, although we can be sure that inflation will continuously fluctuate up and down, as it always has.

                        Now that we have a better understanding on the trends of inflation rate and how hard it is to predict the inflation rate, what does this tell us?

                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-3">
                        This tells us that as much as possible, we should try to be aware of the overall economy and how it can affect us. A lack of understanding of inflation and how it changes can leave us vulnerable to the possible dangers of its changes. It is never a bad characteristic to understand the economy and be aware of its changes because, in the long run, it will help us make better decisions now especially since it is very unpredictable by nature.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Another interesting, or maybe not so interesting, thing is that it is extremely difficult to predict the inflation rate. Since we are purely limited to historical data and the parameters that these may provide to us, we are limited to the capabilities of mathematical models.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Meanwhile, inflation is very much influenced by real-world events happening in real time. While we cannot control the economy, the inflation rate, or the prices of goods and services, by knowing and understanding these concepts, we can become more conscious about how we earn and spend our money to protect ourselves from the impacts inflation can bring.</p>

Additionally, by identifying which commodities are considered essential to our lifestyle, we can try to find ways to lower our spending on them, especially if their prices have increased.

                                Instead of trying to predict inflation rate, future research could focus on identifying the factors of inflation rate such as why there was a sudden increase in the inflation rate of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco in 2008, etc. This is to raise awareness of how social, political, or economic events affect inflation.

                                Future projects could also create different prediction models that predict inflation in different ways by considering different pros and cons - they could, for example, sacrifice the accuracy of our model to allow for more randomness in the predictions. Different models have different pros and cons.
