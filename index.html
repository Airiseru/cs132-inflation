        Hi! We are <..> and our project aims to analyze the inflation rate of the Philippines from 1995 until 2023. With
          the use of data science and its different tools, we attempt to better understand the trend of inflation rate
          and possible factors or events that affects this.

    <h1 class="prim-white big">Overview</h1>
    <p class="prim-white">Did you know that in 2012, bangus (or milkfish) was ₱76 less expensive per kilo than in 2022
      (Statista, 2023)? As prices continue to rise over time, <span class="highlight">people are finding it more and more difficult to afford
      things that they used to be able to afford</span>. Will the general public be able to keep up with the increase in prices
      moving forward? What exactly are the factors that affect the apparent increase in prices? How worried should we be
      given that inflation is being viewed as an “urgent national concern?”</p>
    <br>
    <div class="prim-white references">

    <h1 class="prim-white big">
      Problem
    </h1>
    <p class="prim-white">
      That is why we decided to focus on inflation rate. We wanted to see the trend of inflation rate and determine the
      possible factors or events that ultimately affect the ongoing worry of being able to afford basic needs and wants.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="prim-white">
      Specifically, the lack of awareness and understanding about inflation and its effects causes a negative perception on the topic.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h1 class="prim-white big">Solution</h1>
    <p class="prim-white">
      We want to use data science to gather facts about inflation, analyze its trends, and possibly predict inflation rates to increase awareness, change our perception of inflation, and possibly take steps to minimize its effects on our lives.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h1 class="prim-white big">Background</h1>
    <p class="prim-white">
      The title of “the Sick Man of Asia” has once again been given to the Philippines.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="prim-white">
      In recent years, the Philippines has experienced a plethora of problems regarding inflation, as the average yearly
      inflation has soared to 6.6%, which makes the Philippines the country with the highest inflation rate among all
      Southeast Asian nations ever since the pandemic.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="prim-white">
      However despite the increase of inflation and overall price of goods, majority of the workers have yet to receive
      an increase of wage. In fact, majority of the full-time workers receive an average monthly basic pay of PHP
      13,000. That is why, in the Philippines, inflation is mostly perceived in a negative light due to the concern that
      it has adverse effects on the people, especially for those with a limited income.

      Hypothesis
    </h1>
    <p class="prim-white">
      This made us curious...
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="prim-white">
      How does the inflation rate (of each commodity group) change throughout the years?
    </p>
    <p class="prim-white">
      Null Hypothesis: Inflation rates of the commodities in Group A increases over time while the rest does not
      increase or decrease significantly over time.
    </p>
    <p class="prim-white">
      Alternative Hypothesis: Inflation rates of the commodities in Group A does not increase over time while the rest
      increases/decreases significantly.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="prim-white">
      How much does the rate of NCR differ from or affect the rate of areas outside NCR (AONCR)?
    </p>
    <p class="prim-white">
      Null Hypothesis: In all commodity groups, the inflation rate of AONCR is dependent on the rate of NCR.
    </p>
    <p class="prim-white">
      Alternative Hypothesis: In all commodity groups, the inflation rate of AONCR is not dependent on the rate of NCR.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="prim-white">
      Commodities labelled as group A (categorized by the group):
    </p>
    <ul class="prim-white">
      <li>- Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages</li>
      <li>- Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco</li>
      <li>- Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas, and other Fuels</li>
      <li>- Transport</li>
      <li>- Information and Communication</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h1 class="prim-white big">Action Plan</h1>
    <p class="prim-white">
      Use statistics and plot the points to visualize and analyze the trend of inflation. Identify events and possible
      causes of (upward or downward) spikes in the inflation rate.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h1 class="prim-white big">
      Data Collection
    </h1>
    <p class="prim-white">
      After searching the internet, we found a dataset from the website of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) containing
      information about inflation, purchasing power, and CPI collected by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).
    </p>
    <br>

    <h1 class="prim-white big">About our data set…</h1>
    <ul class="prim-white">
      <li>- Only contains data regarding inflation rate -- every month from 1995 to 2023</li>
      <li>- Split into 3 sections: Philippines, NCR, and AONCR</li>
      <li>- 13 commodity groups -- removed the “Financial Services” commodity group due to the lack of data points</li>
      <li>- 13,572 total data cells -- 348 rows x 13 commodities x 3 sections</li>
    </ul>
